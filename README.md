# Ressl AI Assignment – Task 2: MCP Server (Node.js)

This project implements a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** using Node.js and the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
The server provides a single tool named **`search_keyword`** that searches for a given keyword inside a text file.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ressl-mcp-server.git
cd ressl-mcp-server
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4️⃣ Run the MCP Server

```bash
npm run start
```

You should see this in your terminal:

```

```

## 🧪 Test Using MCP Inspector

### Step 1 – Install Inspector

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

### Step 2 – Launch Inspector with the Server

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector ./build/index.js
```

This will open **MCP Inspector** in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

### Step 3 – Provide Sample Input

* **filePath:** Full path to your sample file (e.g., `C:\Users\Aditya\Downloads\Ressl\sample.txt`)
* **keyword:** The word you want to search (e.g., `keyword`)

Click **Run Tool** and view the results in the output panel.

📸 Take a screenshot of this Inspector view showing both **input and output**, and attach it in your submission document.

## 🧾 Example Output

```

Line 9: This line contains the word keyword for testing keyword search.
